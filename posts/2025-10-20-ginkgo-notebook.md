This year was heavy with woodworking, and lately, lighter crafts started calling me again.

I carved a ginkgo leaf from lino—it turned out surprisingly decent for a first try. Then I bound a small A6 notebook: cardboard covers, Rives textured paper, simple pamphlet binding with waxed thread.

Without a paper guillotine, I trimmed the edges by hand and rounded each corner one by one. I stamped the ginkgo on the cover with black paint, and apart from a single rogue fingerprint, it came out just as I’d hoped.

It’s simple, fits in my hand perfectly, and makes me excited to see what I’ll fill it with.

Somewhere in the rhythm of my life, birds have been a quiet, constant presence. Perched on branches, gliding through open skies, or simply watching the world with that sharp, knowing gaze‚Äîthese small creatures have a way of reminding me to pause and notice. And when I do, I unconsciously smile.

Birds fascinate me‚Äînot just for their movement and freedom, but for the intricate details in their feathers, the way they observe their surroundings, and the quiet moments they allow when I stop to notice them. Over time, I‚Äôve captured a set of bird portraits that I keep on rotation (a little round robin, if you will) as my desktop background. They bring a sense of stillness, curiosity, and fleeting connection.

Birds, for me, have always been tied to rhythm and story‚Äîboth in nature, and in the music that has accompanied my thoughts on them: 
- I wholeheartedly recommend [Hidden Orchestra‚Äôs Wingbeats](https://hiddenorchestra.bandcamp.com/album/wingbeats). It‚Äôs a stunning piece of music, and what makes it even more special for me is that the birds are treated as an individual instrument in the released source tracks on the album. 
- I also recommend [Laurie Anderson‚Äôs The Beginning of Memory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RZpphITFM4), a moving imagining of how memory was born.

In a way, this collection is part of that same thread‚Äîsomething fleeting, yet worth holding onto.

These birds have been my quiet digital companions for years, shifting with light and mood. Now, I‚Äôd love to share them with you.

### A Little More About This Collection
This curated set includes nine high-resolution images (available in 16:9 and 16:10), designed to be detailed enough to appreciate yet subtle enough to sit comfortably as a background. Each bird carries its own presence‚Äîsome mid-flight, some still, each with a quiet story to tell.

title: 'Piano Keys in Oak: A Coat Rack That Refused to Be Ordinary'
excerpt: What began as a simple coat rack commission became a statement piece, featuring a live edge oak slab and a piano-style folding mechanism that blends form and function in a way that deeply inspires me.

What began as ‚Äújust a coat rack‚Äù for a new fitness room quickly turned into something far more personal. The set included a modern oak shoe rack and a dining-style oak tabletop, but this piece became the wildcard: equal parts design experiment and personal challenge.

{% renderMedia media.content.img08 %}

At the lumberyard, I stumbled upon an oak slab with a striking live edge. It wasn‚Äôt part of the original plan, but the moment I saw it, I knew I had to keep that raw, organic contour. It meant extra work and custom solutions, but it also promised a chance to make something truly mine.

{% renderMedia media.content.img01 %}

The hinge system was its own adventure. Before committing to oak, I started with real *CAD* but later I turned to another flavour of CAD that stands for *Cardboard Aided Design*. Prototyping the folding motion with cardboard, then refining it in plywood, gave me the confidence to move on to solid wood.

Only after the plywood template felt right did I commit to oak. The mechanism itself is simple in principle but demanding in execution: each hook folds out like the keys of a piano, disappearing flush when not in use.

Getting there meant meticulous, almost meditative cycles of assembly, reassembly, sanding, finishing, and testing again. Every adjustment was a respectful discussion with the material: avoiding cracks, respecting the grain, and finding harmony between precision and the organic irregularity.

By the time I lifted the finished piece above my head for the hero photo, I realised it had become more than a commission. It was a synthesis of many things I care about: careful craft, playful engineering, and, above all, the meeting of function and aesthetics.

Now it hangs as a statement piece and a quiet reminder: even in everyday objects, beauty and utility can coexist‚Äîsometimes all it takes is patience, persistence, and a live edge you refuse to cut away.

              <p>A few years ago, I had one of my photographs printed in a larger format, on proper fine art paper, and hung it on the wall of my living room. I treated it as if it were part of a small, private gallery: carefully placed, given space, allowed to exist as more than just an image on a screen.</p>
<p>That was also the year I decided not to buy a Christmas tree. Instead, I made one from sticks and rope. It could be assembled, disassembled, and reused year after year, without cutting down another tree for a few days of decoration.</p>
<p>When I was looking for a good place to hang one of the 2D ornaments, the hanger of the photo turned out to be the best spot. So I took the picture off the wall, fully intending to put it back once the holidays were over.</p>
<p>But the holidays ended, the year turned, and something unexpected happened.</p>
<p>With the new year came a kind of quiet excitement. Instead of rushing to put the same photograph back, I found myself thinking about what it would be like to live with a different image for the year ahead. One that felt right for now. One that could set a tone, rather than just fill a space. And just like that, a small ritual was born.</p>
<p>Since then, every year, when the Christmas ornaments are packed away, I look through my own photographs. I wait for one to speak to me. When it does, I have it printed, and it becomes one of the focal points of my living room—and, indirectly, of my daily life.</p>
<p>The spot matters. The image is visible not only when passing through the room, but also from the dining table and from my bed. I start my days with it. I end my days with it. For a whole year, we look at each other countless times.</p>
<p>In a way, this is my own, very personal “photo of the year” award. One I give quietly, without juries or votes or announcements. And in return, the photograph gets to shape my days. Sometimes subtly, sometimes more directly, simply by being there.</p>
<p>This year, I chose a submerging bird to accompany me.</p>

<h2>Notes on the object itself</h2>
<p>The print is made as a giclée on 100% cotton, acid-free, gently textured Hahnemühle Photo Rag Baryta paper. It’s mounted on aluminium dibond, without any framing. A hanger and spacers are glued to the back, so the shadow cast by the print itself becomes an ever-changing frame, depending on the light and the time of day. When choosing the print's size, I usually aim for a resolution of around 240 PPI.</p>

              <h2>plugdata</h2>
<p>For the past two weeks, I’ve been diving into <a href="https://plugdata.org/">plugdata</a>, a modern reimagining of Pure Data, a &quot;visual programming environment designed for sound experimentation, prototyping, and education&quot;. If you've ever been fascinated by modular synths, interactive sound design, or generative music, plugdata makes these ideas instantly accessible, so it instantly won me over.</p>
<p>It offers the same enjoyment for me that working with modular synthesizers (both in the physical world and via emulations like <a href="https://vcvrack.com/">vcvrack</a>) or the <a href="https://empresseffects.com/products/zoia">Empress Zoia</a> always had. I love modular thinking—connecting objects, seeing the flow of information—and plugdata aligns perfectly with that mindset.</p>
<h2>The Catalyst: A Local Workshop on Electronic Instruments</h2>
<p>I’ve been experimenting with music, instruments, and coding for years, but two weeks ago, I stumbled upon a three-part <a href="https://adapterujbuda.hu/hangszerepito-kurzus/">electronic instrument workshop</a> nearby. The first session introduced the fundamentals of sound synthesis in <a href="http://cycling74.com/">Max</a>—and just like that, I was all in again.</p>
<p>The workshop reignited something in me—this desire to build something that exists outside of a traditional computer setup, something tangible and expressive. That led me down a rabbit hole of research into embeddable systems that could support the kind of instruments I want to build. That’s how I landed on the <a href="https://electro-smith.com/products/daisy-seed">Electrosmith Daisy Seed</a>, a powerful microcontroller designed for audio applications. It can host Pure Data patches (converted to C++), meaning I could eventually run my creations as standalone instruments—no laptop required. That vision became my new north star. But before I could get there, I wanted to test something simpler: how motion could shape sound in real-time.</p>
<h2>Bringing Motion into the Equation</h2>
<p>After spending hours patching in plugdata, I wondered—what if I could control sound with motion? I had an early version of a <a href="https://microbit.org/">micro:bit</a> lying around, which has a built-in accelerometer. The idea was simple: use the XYZ coordinates of the micro:bit's accelerometer to modify parameters in my patch.</p>
<p>To make this work, I:</p>
<ul>
<li>flashed a custom JavaScript program onto the micro:bit to continuously send accelerometer data,</li>
<li>ran a Python script using <a href="https://pypi.org/project/python-osc/">python-osc</a> to translate motion data into a format plugdata can read, and</li>
<li>modified my plugdata patch to receive, filter, and scale the motion data to control sound in real-time.</li>
</ul>

<h2>A Tiny Card, a Big Feeling</h2>
<p>And then, it worked.</p>
<figure class="image is-16by9 block">
  <iframe
    class="has-ratio"
    width="560"
    height="315"
    src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JhcDPnzj3jU?si=D3seO8Nk-e73dnZJ"
    title="YouTube video player"

    allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" 
    allowfullscreen
  ></iframe>
</figure>
<p>I lifted my hand, tilting the tiny card ever so slightly. Instantly, the sound shifted—trembling, bending, shimmering—like a living thing responding to my touch. For a moment, it felt like I was sculpting sound in mid-air. Pure magic.</p>
<p>It reminded me of watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QtklTXbKUQ&amp;t=689s">Imogen Heap’s Tiny Desk performance</a>, where she demonstrated her MiMU gloves. That performance was one of many inspirations that planted a seed in my mind years ago—of making music in a way that feels fluid, intuitive, and physically expressive.</p>
<h2>Code &amp; Patch Downloads</h2>
<p>For anyone interested in taking a closer look at this setup, find my experimental code and patcher <a href="https://gist.github.com/freegyes/db35bc8d0b530abe511fdf8a1d54cdd7">here</a>.</p>
<h2>Takeaways &amp; Next Steps</h2>
<p>This was a small experiment, but it opened up so many possibilities. What if I combine this with other sensors? What if I replace the micro:bit with a more powerful and versatile device? What if the instrument I eventually build is less about pushing buttons and more about sculpting sound in space?</p>
<p>This was just a small wave of my hand, but it felt like a giant step toward something bigger—an instrument that blends woodworking, sound, coding, and visuals into something truly expressive. I’m hooked.</p>
<h2>If You’re Curious</h2>
<p>If Max, Pure Data, or plugdata sounds like your kind of thing, <a href="https://www.takumiogata.com/">Takumi Ogata</a>’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1o5Wasmd8yU&amp;list=PLyFkFo29zHvD4eRftIAjcLqIXCtSo7w8g&amp;ab_channel=SoundSimulator">Sound Simulator YouTube series</a> has been my main guide so far, and I can’t recommend it enough—and if you end up experimenting with it, I’d love to hear what you create.</p>

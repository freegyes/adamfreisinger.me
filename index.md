    title: At First Glance
    content1: I’m a curious generalist who blends hands-on creativity with analytical thinking. I love turning abstract ideas into tangible objects, whether it’s woodworking, digital design, or something in between. I’m driven by a passion for high-quality craftsmanship, a love for structure and order, and a dedication to exploring how things work. With a background in education, design, and technology, I bring a balanced approach—both strategic and practical—to every project I take on.
    content2: I value transparency, empathy, and collaboration, preferring to work in calm, well-organized environments that encourage focus and creativity. My goal is to contribute meaningfully, whether by solving complex problems, leading teams, or crafting beautiful, functional products. At the core, I strive to live authentically, sharing what I create and learn along the way.

  A generalist’s quiet corner of the internet. I design, build, and teach—sometimes with wood, sometimes with code, always with curiosity. Exploring craft, design, and technology through projects, field notes, and thoughts on making things that matter.

    Somehow, you’ve landed here. Maybe curiosity brought you—about craft, design, technology, or the art of making things. If so, you’re in good company! My name is Adam, and I spend my days exploring the intersection of these worlds, turning ideas into tangible objects, meaningful experiences, and tools for learning. This site is where I document what I create, what I learn, and the stories behind them.

    Some people find their calling in a single craft. I find mine in the space between them as a generalist. Whether I’m shaping wood, designing digital experiences, or crafting learning tools, the common thread is curiosity—understanding how things work, how they fit together, and how they can be made better.

    Over the years, I’ve worked across design, education, and craftsmanship, always blending structure with creativity. I believe good design is not just about aesthetics but about solving problems in a way that feels intuitive, functional, and meaningful.
